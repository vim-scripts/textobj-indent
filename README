*textobj-indent* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select a block of
lines which are similarly indented to the current line.

For example, if the content of a buffer as follows:
(here ">" means the current line under the cursor,
and "_" means a space to indent)

	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	> __if another_condition_is_satisfied
	  ____call s:do_x()
	  __endif

	  __...
	  __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif

|<Plug>(textobj-indent-a)| will select lines as follows:
(here "|" indicates the selected line)

	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	>|__if another_condition_is_satisfied
	 |____call s:do_x()
	 |__endif
	 |
	 |__...
	 |__endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif

|<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)| will select lines as follows:

	  if some_condition_is_satisfied
	>|__if another_condition_is_satisfied
	 |____call s:do_x()
	 |__endif

	  __...
	  __endif
	  else
	  __...
	  endif

More variants are also available.  See |textobj-indnet-mapping| for the
